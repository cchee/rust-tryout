# rust-tryout

This is just a small project to investigate what Rust is all about. A simple full-stack tryout to understand 
how things work in Rust programming language, dependencies libraries and get a general sense to see if this
is a viable programming language for larger project. I want to understand:-

* How easy and quickly it is to create a Restful API with OAuth 2.0 authentication and https service in Rust
* How easy and quickly it is to create a ORM layer and database migration toolset in Rust
